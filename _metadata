  "description" : "Need a holiday? or a place to call home away from home for a short stay? Maybe you're wondering what ever happened to the protectorate populations after the collapse of Earth?\nPerhaps you're in need of some new crew members - or maybe you just ran out of space in your own ship trying to cram as many colony deeds in there as possible. For whatever the reason, this mod lets you find and board galactic cruise ships and interact with the many dozens of NPCs on board, making this ship, in essence, a home away from home.\n\nThe design is inspired by a ship from another game I play on occassion called Elite: Dangerous. You can encounter this ship like any other normal ship in system. When you deploy your mech you will spawn on a platform rigging upder the ship. Follow the greens on your way into the hull door and your home!\n\n[b]BOARDING PASSES:[/b]\nIf for whatever reason you struggle to find a ship, you can purchase a one way guest pass from a Galactic Cruise Representative - an NPC that stands right next to the 2stop Teleshop. When you use this pass it will teleport you to the ship directly in the lobby. You can also buy a Colony Passport which allows you to build in the cabin spaces and the glass dome at the front of the ship.\n\nIf you want to spawn the passes the item IDs are:\n/spawnitem essential_gc_passport01\n/spawnitem essential_gc_passport01player\n\n[b]WARPING TO THE SHIP VIA COMMANDS:[/b]\nIf you liked the old ship design I have left the file in this mod. If you want to teleport there using a warp command:\n\n/warp InstanceWorld:essential_gc_ship01\n/warp InstanceWorld:essential_gc_ship01passport\n/warp InstanceWorld:essential_gc_ship01player\n/warp InstanceWorld:essential_gc_ship01old\n/warp InstanceWorld:essential_gc_ship01playerold\n\n[b]MOD DEVELOPMENT:[/b]\nThis mod was supposed to be a side project. I've added content I had zero intention of adding. As a result I had to strip things back and focus on the core of what this mod is supposed to be - encounterable npc ships. If players want certain things or features I'm happy for you to take this mod and patch it in your own way. All the tools are there. I might add small and medium version of this ship but I have no intention of doing that any time soon. I'm happy to work with people if they want to see that content. I did spend a bit of time working on just the background set pieces. If someone wants to work on the floor plans for new ships again I'm also happy to be involved. Just be aware modding is something I do in my off time like most people (^^,)\n\n[b]CONTACT ME:[/b]\nIf you would like to ask me questions or see what I'm up to, check out my [url=https://discord.gg/m2cvz2g]Discord Server[/url] if you want to organise games and various multiplayer related things.\n\n--------------------\n\nOther Mods I Made\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1299446315]The Essential: Jetpack Mod[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1374036173]The Essential: Naked and Screaming Mod[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1490833786]The Essential: Variety Insect Mod[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1382974058]The Essential: Delorian1985[/url]",
